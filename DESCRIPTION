Description: 
    To make it easy to generate random numbers based upon the underlying stats 
    distribution functions. All data is returned in a tidy and structured
    format making working with the data simple and straight forward. Given that the
    data is returned in a tidy 'tibble' it lends itself to working with the rest of the
    'tidyverse'.
